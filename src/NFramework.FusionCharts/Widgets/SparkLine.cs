    /// Spark charts are "data-intense, design-simple, word-sized graphics" charts for embedding in a context of words, numbers, images. 
    /// Whereas the typical chart is designed to show as much data as possible, and is set off from the flow of text, spark charts are intended to be succinct, memorable, and located where they are discussed. Their use inline usually means that they are about the same height as the surrounding text. Also, spark charts can be intensively used in space-efficient executive dashboards to show a lot of KPIs in a single view.
